# found-in-translation

Take gender neutral job title phrases in Finnish, translate them to English using Google Translate, see what genders are attributed to the jobs. The job titles in input.txt are taken from https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luettelo_ammateista.

The results show that Google Translate FI->EN thinks that she is a receptionist, waitress, and model, but also astronomer, programmer, car mechanic, and IT manager. It thus doesn't seem that Google Translate would turn gender neutral pronouns into gender stereotypes at least in any systematic way. However, the big disparity is that Google Translate sees only 57 out of the 618 jobs as female (incl. some translation fails), while the rest are male. The full results are in results.txt.
